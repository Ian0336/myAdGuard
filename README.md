# **Anti-Ad AdGuard Rules**

## **Project Description**
This project implements a Python-based ad-blocking proxy server using the AdGuard rules provided by the Anti-Ad project. The `anti-ad-adguard.txt` file contains the latest ad-blocking rules, which are used to filter and block common ad and tracking requests.
